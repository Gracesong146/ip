# Cathy – The Taskmaster You Didn’t Ask For 👹

> *“If you can’t manage your life, at least let me laugh at your attempts.”* – Cathy

Meet **Cathy**, your ~~friendly~~ brutally honest task assistant. She’s:

- text-based
- *annoyingly persistent*
- **FAST SUPER FAST** (because she doesn’t waste time on your feelings)
- prone to sarcasm 😏

All you need to do is:

1. Download the JAR from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Gracesong146/ip/releases).
2. Run it with `java -jar cathy.jar`. ← yes, that’s inline code, try not to cry.
3. Add your precious tasks.
4. Watch Cathy roast you while you “try” to be productive.
