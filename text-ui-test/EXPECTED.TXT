     Oh look, someone showed up.
     I'm Cathy, your gloriously underappreciated task assistant.

     Here's what I *might* help you with (if you're lucky):

     - There are 3 types of tasks, and yes, you need to follow the format:
         1. ToDos: simple tasks with no date/time. Example command: todo visit new theme park
         2. Deadlines: tasks that must be done before a date/time. Example command: deadline submit report /by 11/10/2019 5pm
         3. Events: tasks with a start and end time. Example command: event team meeting /from 2/10/2019 2pm /to 2/10/2019 4pm
            (Notice the /from and /to – don't forget them!)
     - Type 'on <yyyy-MM-dd>' to see deadlines/events happening on that date.
     - Type 'list' to see your glorious pile of tasks.
     - Type 'mark <number>' to mark a task as done. Try not to mess it up.
     - Type 'unmark <number>' to undo a completed task.
     - Type 'find <keyword>' to search for tasks by description.
     - Type 'help' to see this list of commands. Even I can't help the clueless otherwise.
     - Type 'bye' to leave me in peace.

     You've got 1 tasks now. Try not to lose track this time.

     Excuse you—trying to add a todo with no description?
     Use: todo <desc> and try not to waste my time.

     My brain can't read your mind. Type something.

     Seriously? That deadline format is a mess.
     Try again like you actually read the instructions: deadline <desc> /by <date>

     Wow. You think time flows backwards? Cute.
     The /from date has to come *before* the /to date.
     Try again when you figure out how calendars work.

     Ugh... you again? Fine, I'll repeat it. Pay attention this time.
     I'm Cathy, your gloriously underappreciated task assistant.

     - There are 3 types of tasks, so don't mess up the format:

            (Yes, /from and /to are mandatory. Try not to forget.)
     - Type 'on <yyyy-MM-dd>' to see deadlines/events happening on that date.
     - Type 'list' to see your glorious pile of tasks (again).
     - Type 'mark <number>' to mark a task as done. Don't screw it up.
     - Type 'unmark <number>' to undo a completed task. Not that you'll remember.
     - Type 'find <keyword>' to search for tasks by description.
     - Type 'help' to see this list again... seriously, pay attention.
     - Type 'bye' to finally leave me alone.
     And yes, I'll never repeat this again... so maybe try reading this carefully.
