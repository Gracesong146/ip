     Oh look, someone showed up.
     I'm Cathy, your gloriously underappreciated task assistant.

     Here's what I *might* help you with (if you're lucky):

     - There are 3 types of tasks, and yes, you need to follow the format:
         1. ToDos: simple tasks with no date/time. Example command: todo visit new theme park
         2. Deadlines: tasks that must be done before a date/time. Example command: deadline submit report /by 11/10/2019 5pm
         3. Events: tasks with a start and end time. Example command: event team meeting /from 2/10/2019 2pm /to 2/10/2019 4pm
            (Notice the /from and /to – don’t forget them!)
     - Type 'list' to see your glorious pile of tasks.
     - Type 'mark <number>' to mark a task as done. Try not to mess it up.
     - Type 'unmark <number>' to undo a completed task.
     - Type 'help' to see this list of commands. Even I can’t help the clueless otherwise.
     - Type 'bye' to leave me in peace.

     Darling, that task’s already done. No need to be an overachiever.
    ____________________________________________________________

     Fine, it lives to torment you another day:
        [D][ ] return book (by: Sunday)
    ____________________________________________________________

    ____________________________________________________________

     Task 2 is already unmarked.
     Stop trying to double negative your way through life.
    ____________________________________________________________

    ____________________________________________________________

     Hmm… fascinating gibberish.
     Try again, or type "help" to see what I actually understand.
    ____________________________________________________________

    ____________________________________________________________

     Ugh… you again? Fine, I’ll repeat it. Pay attention this time.
     I'm Cathy, your gloriously underappreciated task assistant.

     Here’s what I *might* help you with (if your brain can handle it):

     - There are 3 types of tasks, so don’t mess up the format:
         1. ToDos: simple tasks with no date/time. Example: todo visit new theme park
         2. Deadlines: must be done before a date/time. Example: deadline submit report /by 11/10/2019 5pm
         3. Events: start and end times required. Example: event team meeting /from 2/10/2019 2pm /to 2/10/2019 4pm
            (Yes, /from and /to are mandatory. Try not to forget.)
     - Type 'list' to see your glorious pile of tasks (again).
     - Type 'mark <number>' to mark a task as done. Don’t screw it up.
     - Type 'unmark <number>' to undo a completed task. Not that you’ll remember.
     - Type 'help' to see this list again… seriously, pay attention.
     - Type 'bye' to finally leave me alone.
     And yes, I’ll never repeat this again… so maybe try reading this carefully.
